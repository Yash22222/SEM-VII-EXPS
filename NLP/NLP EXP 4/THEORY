AIM - Perform Morphological Analysis and Word Generation for any Given Text  

THEORY - 
Morphological Analysis:-
Morphological analysis is the study of the structure of words. It involves breaking down words into their component morphemes, which are the smallest units of meaning. This analysis helps in understanding the formation, structure, and meaning of words. Morphological analysis includes:

1. Root Words: The core part of the word that carries the primary meaning.
2. Affixes: Prefixes (e.g., "un-"), suffixes (e.g., "-ly"), infixes, and circumfixes that modify the meaning of the root.
3. Derivational Morphemes: Change the meaning or grammatical category of the root (e.g., "happiness" from "happy").
4. Inflectional Morphemes: Modify the tense, number, aspect, mood, etc., of the root (e.g., "runs" from "run").

Word Generation:-
Word generation involves creating new words based on existing roots and morphological patterns. This process can be used to generate:

1. Derived Words: New words formed by adding prefixes or suffixes to a root (e.g., "happily" from "happy").
2. Inflected Forms: Variations of a word to express different grammatical categories (e.g., "walked" from "walk").
3. Compounds: Words formed by combining two or more roots (e.g., "notebook" from "note" + "book").

Implementation
Here's how morphological analysis and word generation can be practically implemented in Python:

1. Morphological Analysis: Using libraries like nltk and spacy, you can analyze words to extract their meanings, parts of speech, and other linguistic features.
2. Word Generation: You can create new words by appending standard suffixes to a root or combining multiple roots.

Conclusion
The Python script provided demonstrates both morphological analysis and word generation using natural language processing techniques. By leveraging libraries such as nltk and spacy, you can:

1. Analyze Words: Extract meanings, synonyms, and grammatical properties using nltk and spacy.
2. Generate New Words: Create new words by applying common suffixes to root words.

This approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of word structures and the ability to explore linguistic creativity by generating new forms of words.
