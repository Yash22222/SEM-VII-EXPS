AIM - To design the architecture and implement an autoencoder model for image denoising.

Theory -
Image Denoising - Image denoising is the process of removing noise or unwanted artifacts from an image, enhancing its visual quality and making it more suitable for analysis. 
Noise in images can come from various sources, such as sensor limitations, compression artifacts, transmission errors, or environmental factors. 
The objective of denoising is to recover the original image as accurately as possible while minimizing the impact of noise.

With the rise of deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), image denoising has advanced significantly. 
Techniques like denoising autoencoders have shown impressive results by learning to remove noise from images. Autoencoders consist of an encoder-decoder structure: 
the encoder compresses the image, removing noise in the process, and the decoder reconstructs a cleaner version of the image.

Conclusion -
In this experiment, we designed and implemented an autoencoder model for image denoising. The model utilized convolutional layers for feature extraction and upsampling layers for reconstruction. 
By training the autoencoder on noisy images from the MNIST dataset, we effectively reduced noise and improved the clarity of the test images. 
This approach demonstrates the effectiveness of autoencoders for image denoising tasks, showcasing their ability to learn meaningful representations and remove unwanted artifacts while preserving essential features of the original image.
