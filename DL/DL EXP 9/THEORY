AIM - Design and implement a CNN model for image classification.

THEORY -  Image Classification
Image classification is a computer vision task that involves assigning a label or category to an image from a predefined set of classes. 
This process enables AI to interpret and understand the contents of images in a manner similar to human perception. 
The key steps involved in image classification include:

1. Data Collection: Collecting a labeled dataset of images where each image belongs to a specific class, such as "cat" or "dog."
2. Data Preprocessing: This step involves resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and dividing the dataset into training and testing sets. Data augmentation, such as rotation or flipping, 
   can enhance model generalization by increasing the variability in training data.
3. Feature Extraction: CNNs, unlike traditional methods, learn relevant features directly from the raw pixel data, such as edges, shapes, and textures, without requiring manual feature engineering.
4. Model Training: Using labeled training data, CNNs learn to classify images by identifying unique patterns associated with each class.
5. Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on a test set to assess its generalization ability using metrics like accuracy, precision, or F1-score.
6. Model Deployment: Once satisfactory performance is achieved, the model is deployed to classify new images. Deployment can be on mobile devices, web services, or integrated within larger systems.

CNNs, due to their unique architecture, are highly effective in image classification tasks. They leverage convolutional layers to process images as grids of pixels, 
automatically extracting hierarchical patterns in the data. Applications of image classification include object detection, facial recognition, medical imaging, and self-driving cars.

CONCLUSION - In this practical, we successfully designed and implemented a CNN model for image classification. The model leverages convolutional layers to automatically extract features from images, 
allowing for efficient and accurate classification. This approach demonstrates the power and versatility of CNNs in processing visual data and is foundational for developing more complex image recognition systems.
With further refinement and experimentation, CNNs can be adapted to handle larger datasets and more complex image classification tasks.
