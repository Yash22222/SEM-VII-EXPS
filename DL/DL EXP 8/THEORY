AIM - Design and implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for digit recognition application.

THEORY - Convolutional Neural Networks
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are specialized deep learning models designed for image recognition and computer vision tasks, 
inspired by the human visual system. CNNs have significantly advanced the field of image processing due to their ability to extract complex features and patterns from images.

Key characteristics of CNNs include:-

1. Convolutional Layers: These layers apply filters (kernels) to detect edges, textures, and patterns in images.
2. Pooling Layers: Pooling layers downsample feature maps, reducing computational complexity and making the network more robust to distortions.
3. Non-linearity (Activation Functions): ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function introduces non-linearity, allowing the CNN to learn complex patterns.
4. Fully Connected Layers: These layers combine features learned from convolutional layers for final classification.
5. Training with Backpropagation: Backpropagation is used to minimize error by updating the networkâ€™s parameters.

Digit Recognition Using CNN - CNNs are well-suited for digit recognition tasks, as they excel at extracting relevant features like edges and shapes that help distinguish digits. 
Key benefits of CNNs in digit recognition include translation invariance, reduced parameters through weight sharing, and robust local feature extraction. 
They perform well even with limited data, achieving real-time predictions suitable for practical applications.

Conclusion - In conclusion, we successfully designed and implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for digit recognition on the MNIST dataset. 
The CNN's architecture allowed it to extract hierarchical features, efficiently recognizing handwritten digits. With high test accuracy, 
this model demonstrates the power of CNNs in computer vision tasks like digit recognition. Further improvements can be made through optimization techniques or more complex architectures, 
making CNNs a strong foundation for advanced image classification tasks.
