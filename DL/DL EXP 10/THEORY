AIM - Design and implement an LSTM model for time series forecasting, handwriting recognition, speech recognition, machine translation, speech activity detection, robot control, video games, etc.

THEORY - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
LSTMs are a specialized form of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) designed to model long-term dependencies in sequential data. 
Traditional RNNs struggle with long-term dependencies due to issues with vanishing and exploding gradients. 
LSTMs address this problem by using a series of gates—forget, input, and output gates—that control the flow of information through the network. 
These gates allow the model to selectively "remember" or "forget" specific parts of the input sequence, enabling it to capture longer-term dependencies effectively.

The architecture of an LSTM cell includes-

1. Forget Gate: Decides which information to discard from the cell state.
2. Input Gate: Updates the cell state with new information.
3. Output Gate: Controls what information is output at each time step.

LSTMs are widely used in applications such as time series forecasting, speech and handwriting recognition, and machine translation. 
They have become popular due to their flexibility and ability to model complex patterns in sequential data.

CONCLUSION - LSTM models are a powerful tool for time series prediction. They excel at capturing temporal dependencies, making them ideal for tasks like handwriting recognition, 
speech recognition, machine translation, and time series forecasting. Their unique gated architecture helps mitigate issues such as exploding and vanishing gradients, 
which commonly hinder traditional RNNs. Through this practical example, we demonstrated the application of an LSTM model in forecasting a noisy sine wave, 
showcasing the LSTM’s effectiveness in handling sequential data.

This LSTM implementation shows that while LSTMs require more complex setups and tuning, their predictive performance makes them invaluable for a wide range of time-dependent applications in deep learning.
